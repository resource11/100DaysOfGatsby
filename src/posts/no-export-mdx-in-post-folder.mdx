## MDX file from posts folder without a default export

Not sure if we want to use the frontmatter GraphQL query in this file though. This page does not use a default export, so it will take on the default layout set by the gatsby-config file.

### Where do I start with this nested file?

The documentation offers guides for all different skill levels, you can
find more info at the Gatsby's [Quick Start page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start)

<!-- This default export overrides the default layout set in the
gasby-config.js file ensuring that the FAQ component isn't wrapped
by other elements -->

<SignupForm />
